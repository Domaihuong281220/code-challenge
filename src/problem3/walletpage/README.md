# WalletPage â€“ Next.js + TypeScript

A small React/Next.js project that displays wallet balances, sorted by blockchain priority, with live USD values.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

* Written in **React** + **TypeScript**
* Uses **Next.js** for routing and SSR
* Wallet balances are:

  * **Filtered** (removes empty balances)
  * **Sorted** (by blockchain priority)
  * **Formatted** (decimal amounts + USD conversion)
* Optimized with `useMemo` to avoid unnecessary recalculations
* Clean folder structure for easy scaling

## ðŸ§  From Problem to Solution

**Original Problem:**
Given a `WalletPage` React component (TypeScript + Hooks) with multiple inefficiencies and anti-patterns, refactor it for performance, readability, and maintainability.

**Issues Found in Original Code:**

1. `getPriority` was recalculated repeatedly inside `filter` and `sort` instead of reusing results.
2. Used an undefined variable `lhsPriority` in filtering.
3. Filter logic was inverted â€” included zero balances instead of excluding them.
4. `formattedBalances` was computed but never used.
5. `any` used for `blockchain` instead of proper TypeScript types.
6. Duplicate logic â€” `getPriority` called multiple times for same values.
7. Used array `index` as React `key` (bad for dynamic lists).
8. Unnecessary renders â€” some derived values werenâ€™t memoized.

**Refactoring Steps Taken:**

* Replaced `switch` with a **priority map** for cleaner lookups.
* Used **`useMemo`** to compute filtered, sorted, and formatted balances in one pass.
* Added proper **TypeScript interfaces** for stronger type safety.
* Removed unused variables and dead code.
* Used **`balance.currency`** as a unique React key.
* Kept hook dependencies minimal and correct.
* Made rendering code simpler by mapping directly to `<WalletRow />`.

**Result:**

* Cleaner, easier-to-read code.
* No redundant computations.
* Stronger type safety.
* More predictable rendering.
